		   README for Z8000 GNU development tools

This repository contains a modified version of the GCC ECOS z8k compiler
adapted by Christian Groessler.
Unfortunately Christian's version didn't work on modern machines, so 
I hacked it to run on my M1 Mac (running Ventura).
I have no idea if it works on other machines.

Follow the instructions on 
www.z80ne.com/m20/sections/download/z8kgcc/z8kgcc.html 

but add 
   -enable-werror=no 
to the configure command.

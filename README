		   README for Z8000 GNU development tools

This repository contains a modified version of the GCC ECOS z8k compiler
adapted by Christian Groessler.
Unfortunately Christian's version didn't work on modern machines, so 
I hacked it to run on my M1 Mac (running Ventura).
It requires GCC (I used GCC 12.2.0).
I have no idea if it works on other machines.

Follow the instructions on 
www.z80ne.com/m20/sections/download/z8kgcc/z8kgcc.html 

but add 
   -enable-werror=no 
to the configure command.

Sometimes the make stops. Just make again. As described in the manual, for target coff the md5 library must be compiled manually.
